# Monocraft

![](images/preview.png)

The font for developers who like Minecraft a bit _too_ much.

*Notice: This project is not affiliated with Minecraft or Mojang in any way and is exclusively a fan project. This font emulates the typeface of the font used in the Minecraft UI, but it does not include any assets or font files from the original game.*

## Features

- Minecraft!
  - The characters in this font were based around the [typeface](https://github.com/IdreesInc/Minecraft-Font) used in the Minecraft UI, with a select few glyphs updated for better readability and spacing
- Monospaced!
  - Each character has been carefully redesigned to work in a monospaced font
  - Thin characters like "i" and "l" have been reworked with tasteful tails and serifs to look better in a monospaced environment
- Programming ligatures!
  - Add some spice to your programming life with all new ligature characters
  - Arrows now look like arrows and comparison operators are easier to see at a glance

If there is another character combination that you feel could be a ligature, feel free to create an issue.

### How were these characters generated?

Using [FontForge](https://fontforge.org/en-US/), a fantastic and open source font designer.

### Do you have a version with the original Minecraft font (not monospaced)?

I've got you covered, check out my rendition of the Minecraft typeface [here](https://github.com/IdreesInc/Minecraft-Font).

### What if I want to use a font that's actually good?

Understandable, check out [Fira Code](https://github.com/tonsky/FiraCode) for a font with amazing attention to detail, or [Scientifica](https://github.com/nerdypepper/scientifica) for a bitmap font similar to this.
